This folder contains two rudimentary implementations
of Game of Life.

(1) a jar file named **ChargepointDemo.jar**. To run it, simply execute "java -jar ChargePointDemo.jar". There is a very basic help option.

(2) a py file named **chargepoint_demo.py**. This has a standard --help option

Both variants contain a tiny dictioanry of some interesting demo patterns,
all taken from wikipedia.

The Java program can produce both a console output as
well as a self-refreshing html page (the html file name
is shown on console).

The python program produces only a console output. Adding
html output would be trivial as the basic work has already
been done in the java variant
